    // 1) Write (define) a static method named displayGreeting, 
    //  that takes no arguments and returns no value. 
    //  When this function is called, it should print the text "Hello, and welcome!".
    
    
    //2) Write (define) a static method named displayText, 
    //  that takes a single String argument and returns no value. 
    //  When this function is called, it should print the value of the argument that was passed to it.
    
    
    //3) Write (define) a static method named printTotal, 
    //  that takes three int arguments. 
    //  When this function is called, it should print the sum of the three arguments passed to it. 
    //  This function should return no value.
    
    
    //4) Write (define) a static method named getTotal, 
    //  that takes three int arguments. 
    //  When this function is called, it should return the sum 
    //  of the three arguments passed to it as an int.
    
    
    //5) Write (define) a static method named getAverage, 
    //  that takes three int arguments. 
    //  When this function is called, it should return the average 
    //  of the three arguments passed to it as a double.
    
    
    //6) Write (define) a static method named averageLength, 
    //  that takes three String arguments. 
    //  When this function is called, it should return the average length (number of characters) 
    //  of the String arguments passed to it as a double.
    
    
    //7) Write (define) a static method named lengthOfShortest, 
    //  that takes two String arguments. When this function is called, 
    //  it should return the length (number of characters) 
    //  of the shortest String argument passed to it as an int.
    
    
    //8) Write (define) a static method named stringOfStars, 
    //  that takes one String argument.
    //  When this function is called, it should return a String of asterisks (*) 
    //  that is the same length as the string argument passed to it.
    
    
    //9) Write (define) a static method named maxStringOfStars, 
    //  that takes two String arguments. 
    //  When this function is called, it should return a String of asterisks (*) 
    //  that is the same length as the longest string argument passed to it.
    
    
    //10) Write (define) a static method named midStringOfStars, 
    //   that takes three String arguments. 
    //   When this function is called, it should return a String of asterisks (*) 
    //   that is the same length as the string argument with the length 
    //   that would be in the middle if the lengths of the arguments were arranged in ascending order.
